TODO:
    - Player status can't be reset right now
    - If a player has been removed from the whitelist the status should be reset to "newPlayer"

TODO Exception Handling:
    - Handle NumberFormatException
    - Handle IOException
    - Handle FileNotFoundException (playerJoinTriesTemplate)


TODO in the future:
    - Better name for "playerJoinTries"
