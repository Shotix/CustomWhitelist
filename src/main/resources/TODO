FIXME:
    - Player is able to manually reconnect without having used "/updateStatus"
        --> Whats happening:
            Player is in spectator mode with the blindness effect
        --> Possible solution:
            Give the player a certain status (notValid). This status can be implemented in the playerJoinTimes.json File
            After using "/updateStatus" the status could be updated to (valid). After that the counter in the playerJoinTimes will be reset to 0;
        --> Possible simplifications:
            No need to check if the player is on the whitelist. A simple check in the playerJoinTries file would be enough

TODO Exception Handling:
    - Handle NumberFormatException (HandleFiles.java)
    - Handle IOException (HandleFiles.java)


TODO in the future:
    - Better name for "playerJoinTries"
    - When a new player joins his name + numberOfTries + status needs to be written into "playerJoinTries"
