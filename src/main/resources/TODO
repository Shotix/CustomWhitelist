TODO:
    - Player is now not able to be transferred from the "newPlayer" Status to the "verified" status
        --> Implementation still needed

TODO Exception Handling:
    - Handle NumberFormatException (HandleFiles.java)
    - Handle IOException (HandleFiles.java)


TODO in the future:
    - Better name for "playerJoinTries"
    - When a new player joins his name + numberOfTries + status needs to be written into "playerJoinTries"
