<h1 align="center">Custom Whitelist<project-name></h1>

<p align="center"><project-description>With this Bukkit Minecraft Plugin everybody is able to join your server but only Players that have the correct Password are able to play on it.</p>

## Available Commands

As a normal player you can run the following commands:

### `"/join [password]"`,

When a user is joining the server and the new user is currently <b>not</b> on the whitelist his movement ist locked and visibility reduced. In order to play on the server he needs to use the command `"/join [password]"`. He has three tries on logging in with the correct password. If he fails to input the correct password after this three trys he will be permanently banned from the server. This can be reset with the simple `pardon [player]` command.

### `"/updateStatus"`,

If you have used the `/join [password]` command you can use the `/updateStatus` command after that to update your status to `joinable`. After this the player will be kicked and he now can rejoin and play with the rest of the server.
